Before study hacking, you need the Network basics for hackers, like TCP/IP knowleage.

There are the books need to read in my life:
+ Linux Basics for Hackers
+ Gray Hat Hacking
+ This is How They Tell Me the World Ends
+ Hands On Hacking
+ Penetration Testing
+ Getting started Becoming a Master Hacker
+ The Science of Human Hacking
+ Black Hat Python
+ Hacking Connected Cars
+ Hacking:The Art of Exploitation
+ Pentesting Blueprint
+ Hacking APIs
+ Bug Bounty Bootcamp
+ The TCP/IP Guide
+ Web Hacker's Handbook
+ Black Hat Go
+ Hacker's Playbook

And there is a publishing company called "* No Starch Press *", which geared towards the geek, hacker, and DIY subcultures.
